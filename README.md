- 👋 Hi, I’m Chandramouli, a PhD scholar at IISc, Bangalore.
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Molecular Dynamics simulations, Biomolecular structure and function.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on MD simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins and its membrane interactions. 
- I'm exploring the conformational landscape of IDPs on membrane and the changes in membrane properties due to IDPs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using various MD analysis tools.
